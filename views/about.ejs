                  an animal shelter and a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation
                  center recognized by the Central Zoo Authority. Karunashram,
                  the animal shelter spread over 15 acres is testimony to their
                  commitment to Baba’s message. The facility is permanent home
                  for numerous cattle, dogs, pigs, and other street animals who
                  are unable to fend for themselves. <br />
